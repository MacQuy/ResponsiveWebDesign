            <h2>Major Research Contributions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Turing Machine (1936)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a tape according to a set of rules.</li>
                        <li>Provided a formalization of the concept of computation and algorithms.</li>
                        <li>Helped solve the Entscheidungsproblem, proving that some problems are undecidable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Cryptanalysis during WWII (1939–1945)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Worked at Bletchley Park, the British codebreaking center.</li>
                        <li>Key role in breaking the Enigma cipher, used by Nazi Germany.</li>
                        <li>Developed the Bombe machine, which helped decode German military messages.</li>
                        <li>His work is believed to have shortened WWII by several years and saved millions of lives.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Early Computer Development (Post-War)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Worked on the design of one of the earliest stored-program computers: the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) at the National Physical Laboratory.</li>
                        <li>Developed some of the first programming concepts for computers.</li>
                        <li>Created early designs for machine architecture and algorithms.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Mathematical Biology</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Later in his life, he studied morphogenesis — the process that causes an organism to develop its shape.</li>
                        <li>Proposed Turing patterns, explaining how patterns like stripes and spots could form in animals.</li>
                        <li>His 1952 paper “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis” laid the groundwork for mathematical biology.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proposed the famous Turing Test in 1950 as a criterion for machine intelligence.</li>
                        <li>Asked the question: “Can machines think?” in his paper <i>“Computing Machinery and Intelligence.”</i></li>
                        <li>Laid the philosophical and theoretical foundation for AI.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
